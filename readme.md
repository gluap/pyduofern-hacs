pyduofern-hacs
==============

This repository contains hacs integration for [pyduofern](https://github.com/gluap/pyduofern).

As reported in [#31](https://github.com/gluap/pyduofern/issues/31) 10-Digit codes recently announced by Rademacher are not supported as of now as the handshake/
protocol for these devices was not reverse engineered by anyone as far as I know.

You can use this repo with [hacs](https://hacs.xyz)

Setting up pyduofern in hacs
----------------------------

1. In *HACS->Integrations* on the top right click on **â‹®** and select *custom repositories*.

2. Add a repo with URL ``https://github.com/gluap/pyduofern-hacs`` and type **integration**

3. Back in *HACS->Integrations* search for *duofern*

4. In Homeassistant go to *Configuration -> Integrations*, click the + sign to add an integration and search for *dufoern*

5. Complete the setup dialog

Setup with homeassistant core (no Homeassistant OS)
---------------------------------------------------
To use ``pyduofern`` within [Homeassistant](https://home-assistant.io/), add the ``custom_components`` from https://github.com/gluap/pyduofern-hacs  to
``~/.homeassistant/`` directory and enable it by adding the following to your ``configuration.yaml``::

    duofern:
       # (4 hex digits as code required, last 4 digits if migrating from FHEM, 10 digit devices are not supported as of now)
       code: deda
       # Optional options, comment in if required:
       # serial_port: /dev/ttyUSB0
       #   # serial_port defaults to
       #   # /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Rademacher_DuoFern_USB-Stick_WR04ZFP4-if00-port0
       #   # which should work on most linuxes
       # config_file: ~/duofern.json
       #   # config_file defaults to duofern.json in homeassistant folder (assuming custom_component is used)

### Usage

There are some services you can call via the service interface. A few of these to get you started:

``duofern.start_pairing`` starts the pairing mode for a given number of seconds. After pairing reload the integration to make the new devices visible.

``duofern.ask_for_update``

Ask duofern devices to re-send their state in case. Can be used in setups where RF is finnicky.

``duofern.dump_device_state``
Dump the current last received state for all duofern modules as a warning level message to the log. This reflects the current state of all RF messages received from devices - What's not here wasn't received by the stick or came in garbled.

``duofern.sync_devices``
Write the duofern config file with the known devices. normally not required from the user.

``duofern.set_update_interval``
Set the automatic broadcasting of a "please send an update" interval, which triggers a device status update. Accepts all positive values, e. g. "10" for a 10 minutes interval. Using "0" disables the automatic update which is then also logged to Home Assistant. Be aware that this setting is not persistent. Use an automation to trigger this at Home Assistant start if you always want it to be set to your custom value.
